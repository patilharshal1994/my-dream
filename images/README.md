## Image Guidelines

- **Format**: Use WebP for modern browsers, with PNG/JPG fallbacks
- **Optimization**: Compress images for web use
- **Responsive**: Provide multiple sizes for different screen densities
- **Alt Text**: Always include descriptive alt text for accessibility

## Current Implementation

The website currently uses Font Awesome icons and CSS-generated placeholders. Replace these with actual images as needed:

- Team member photos in About page
- Project screenshots in Portfolio
- Blog featured images
- Service illustrations
- Company office photos

## Image Placeholders

The website includes placeholder systems that can be easily replaced with real images by updating the HTML and CSS accordingly.
